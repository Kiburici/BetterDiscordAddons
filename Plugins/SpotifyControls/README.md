# Spotify Controls 

Adds a Control Panel while listening to Spotify on a connected Account


Edit by me 
-> 

Replace the function of share button from copy in clipboard to paste in a message text box, It doesn't automatically send the message with the URL of the song because its breaking the ToS of Discord&BetterDiscord. You need to manually send the message.
